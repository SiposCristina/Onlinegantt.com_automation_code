<h3>Product Information</h3> <p> The Online Gantt Chart (https://www.onlinegantt.com) is a web-based project management tool that helps visualize tasks and timelines in a clear, interactive format. It uses a horizontal bar chart to display project schedules, showing task durations, dependencies, and milestones. It also has features like resource allocation, progress tracking, multiple color schemes, project view, resource view, resource and settings editing.<br>
The Online Gantt Chart has a cloud version and a local version. I tested only the local version, that does not require creating an account.
